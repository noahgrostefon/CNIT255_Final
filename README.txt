Everyone needs to create their own Github free account. Any work that you do must be saved and then "pushed" to the master branch. 

Before you start making changes, you should do a "pull" request. This will download all of the updated files from the master branch into your branch so you can work with the most recent changes.

GitHub essentially works like Google Drive, but is a lot more automated. Anytime you want to start working, you "pull" the files from github and it will automatically update everything. Once you are done making changes and have saved those changes to your computer, you then "push" the changes to GitHub. GitHub will automatically add changes from multiple people to the documents. If there are any conflicts, GitHub will display the conflicts in the code.

All coding will still be done in Visual Studio, GitHub just acts as a shared folder for everybody to simultaneously work on the same project.

This website is a guide to how this works.

These videos show how the program works:  (These videos demonstrate how to use it via command line through GitShell. You can either use the Desktop App or the commang line version, though the desktop app can be a bit confusing. They both work the same way though.)
