Everyone needs to create their own Github free account. Once you are on the project, you must create your own branch. Any work that you do must be done on your branch then "pushed" to the master branch.

Whenever you start making changes, you should do a "pull" request. This will download all of the updated files from the master branch into your branch so you can work with the most recent changes.

This website is a guide to how this works.
